Here are the product application that I have already made from Online Course Learning I took , Including :

- Integration with Midtrans Payment Gateway

- Slicing Design to React Native



I participated for all features inside the applications , and I also created some notes of creating the Apps from Scratch , because learning from the material / turoial is not easy to re-learn.
